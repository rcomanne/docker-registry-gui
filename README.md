# Docker registry GUI
A simple ReactJS GUI for a Docker registry V2.

## Run
To run locally, create an `.env` file in the root of the project before starting with the credentials for the registry to connect to.  
```
REACT_APP_REGISTRY_USERNAME = your-username
REACT_APP_REGISTRY_PASSWORD = your-password
```

After that, you can start the server normally.  
```bash
$ npm start
```
